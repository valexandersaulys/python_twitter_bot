python_twitter_bot
==================

My python twitter bot using tweepy to make a faux-pope on twitter! (a la Pope Michael shenanigans).

They python script references a keys.py, which in no way will I add with my real stuff, thus the onus is on y'all. 
This was built with ample help from http://www.dototot.com/
